## Introduction
Recent advancements in AI, pigured a new topic, Multimodality. It's A concept where language models are combined with other forms of abilities to process more than one type of data (e.g. texts). 

Everyone, I am aware of AI, are looking to get into multimodality unless youâ€™re living under a rock or just starting out. I am no different. I have been aware of this concept for more than three years. But, the advancements were so slow and even the demanding hardware allocations made it near impossible for me to experiment and learn it. 


In this repository, I will walk through Multimodality using Pytorch and a few more libraries. Where the goal is to go from basics to advanced.
